Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
My inital idea was - it is so so useful. I've seen couple of designs and systems that seem like descending one from another, and I didn't know how it is accomplished - is this just simple copying the code? And now I know how it is accomplished :)
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future? 
I don't think I can say that something didn't work - I was able to complete all of the homeworks, midterm and project, understood all of the concepts (even though I 'm sure I need more practice)
In terms of advices, first - make sure to complete assignments timely, so you won't fall behind understanding new topics. Be creative with your projects. Definitely come to office hours, to ask YOUR OWN questions as we all have different approach to learning and thinking, so it's better to ask personalized questions for them.
